Visit <https://gmplib.org> for all things gmp.

==linux==

Typically, linux already comes with gmp installed. This true for CSE
servers and should also hold for lab machines.

==Mac OS X==
gmp should build on Mac OS X when the following is installed:

- Xcode + cmd line tools
- gmp <https://gmplib.org>, which in turn needs lzip <http://lzip.nongnu.org/lzip.html>

Last tested 2018/04 on Mac OS X 10.13.3, Xcode 9.3, gmp-6.1.2

==Windows==

I have no idea but would be happy to point to relevant web pages if
someone told me about them.
